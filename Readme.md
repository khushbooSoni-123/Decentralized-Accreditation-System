## Project Vision

The vision is to revolutionize the accreditation process by leveraging blockchain technology. This system aims to ensure that accreditations are tamper-proof, verifiable, and managed without centralized control, fostering global trust in institutional certifications.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Management**: A single admin governs the creation and revocation of accreditations, ensuring streamlined control.
- **Tamper-Proof Records**: All accreditation data is stored on the blockchain, making it immutable and secure.
- **Public Verification**: Accreditation details are accessible for public verification, enhancing transparency.
- **Event Tracking**: Emission of events like `AccreditationCreated` and `AccreditationRevoked` for a complete audit trail.
- **Scalability**: Support for managing multiple accreditations efficiently.



## Future Enhancements

- Multi-admin support for better decentralization.
- Expiry dates for accreditations with automated validity checks.
- A user-friendly interface for interacting with the contract.
- Integration with decentralized identity (DID) systems for enhanced trust.
